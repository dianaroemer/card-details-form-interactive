## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

- Desktop Form


![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Google Bard](bard.google.com) - Provided insights into understanding JS form validation
- [How to block +,-,e in input type Number](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39291997/how-to-block-e-in-input-type-number)
- [Pixlr](pixlr.com) - Free Photoshop in browser, used to check design details like rgb of certain elements and number of pixels separating elements in layout.


### What I learned

When positioning an element relative to its parent, if any transformX or Y is applied to the parent, ensure that the child elements use the same method of transform to ensure similar scaling and movement across responsive viewports. In the future, practice pinning elements to exact spots on their parent element using position absolute. 

A CSS filter effect also applies its effect to any visible children.

Form error management in React can be simultaneously powerful and complicated. Using HTML's innate form management with CSS pseudo-class selectors gives a fairly straightforward method of generating intelligent forms, however React's internal state management can give much more finely grained control of how to build intelligent forms. For example, using a CSS sibling selector in an error field with its native styling set to `display:none;`, it can be easy to toggle the `display:box;` whenever the form generates an error according to a regex or empty criteria. That said, using a regex pattern or built-in HTML pseudo-states can be somewhat limiting in how and when I show the user errors. For example, I don't want to show any errors to the user unless they deliberately a validation criteria, or unless they try to submit an invalid form, in which case, I want to highlight all of the failed validation patterns for the user to fix. With React's built in state management, that should be fairly straightforward if I establish the HTML form with state management and validation in mind. 
  With this application, I didn't use a React based validation system, and instead am relying on primitive regex pattern validation. In the future, I would like to manage validation with React's state, and only show appropriate errors to the user when they're called for. For example, using state to track if a field is empty, whether the field is invalid, whether the user has tried to submit the form and return the appropriate errors back relative to the forms that fail validation (for example, the difference between showing the user "This field can't be empty!" and "This field is invalid!")

  There is a known bug when responsively adjusting the page from desktop view to mobile wherein the stacking on the display cards breaks the page layout. Simply refresh the page to return to normal functionality.

  Form validation is a journey in and of itself. I'm glad that I now understand the two types of validation, live validation with updates on each key-press (which is more difficulty, even with pattern expressions) and triggered validation, which will only check for validation on a single specific event, and can be more finely tuned. Using state management for validity provides some easy knobs to tweak different outputs in different contexts, though I have to wonder about the simplicity of HTML's fairly straightforward setCustomValidity, and would like to explore that functinoality more in the future.




### Continued development

Explore form validation and semantic form structures more. I feel as if my default whenever doing any input of any kind is to immediately throw ``e.preventDefault()`` because built in event behavior doesn't always work intuitively. I'd like to understand events and event bubbling in better contexts. 



### Useful resources

 - [MDN How to structure a web form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/How_to_structure_a_web_form) - Gave me the appropriate semantic HTML for structuring and building an accessible web form.
 - [Credit Card Formatter Function](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/cc-formatter) - The function described on this website gave me a baseline to give the user an easier field to read than 16 numbers consecutively, by adding spaces every fourth number. I modified it slightly to prevent any inputs of a character that isn't a digit.

# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form

![Design preview for the Interactive card details form coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

Want some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

### Expected behaviour

- Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields
- Validate the form fields when the form is submitted
- If there are no errors, display the completed state
- Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state

**⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️: When you create the live version of your project, we recommmend giving it a random name for the URL. This is because with it being a fake credit card form, some browsers will open a warning notice before people can access your project. So it's best to name the project something unrelated to credit cards so that browsers don't show the warning to people viewing your project.**

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

## Submitting your solution

Submit your solution on the platform for the rest of the community to see. Follow our ["Complete guide to submitting solutions"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) for tips on how to do this.

Remember, if you're looking for feedback on your solution, be sure to ask questions when submitting it. The more specific and detailed you are with your questions, the higher the chance you'll get valuable feedback from the community.

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack). 
2. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor**, including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
3. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
